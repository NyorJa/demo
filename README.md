This repository serves as the codebase for a Spring Boot lab project. Its primary use will be for generating content to be distributed on [michaellamb.dev](https://michaellamb.dev).

## IDE

The primary IDE for this demo project is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), available for free.

## Testing

This repo contains `.http` files used with [the REST Client extension from Huachao](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) to provide a "living contract" of basic requests. [REST Client Extension GitHub repo](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) 

These are no plans to create more documentation using these files.

Swagger UI is integrated and provides API documentation automatically during runtime. The latest version of this app is always available at [demo.michaellamb.dev/swagger-ui/](https://demo.michaellamb.dev/swagger-ui/).
